            Have you ever felt sad or frustrated by not being able to say your opinions in a meeting or a group discussion? Have you been criticized by your fellow members while speaking out your views about something?
            If yes, then the group in which you participated is not following the norms which are necessary for the discussion. <br><br>

            Norms are specific rules that one should follow in life. It has a pivotal role in group activities especially in discussions, debates etc...It enables one to express oneself honestly and fearlessly. It
            is very important for effective communication. It leads us to be good listener because it is an
            essential quality to be a leader. 
            
            Chances are you think you’re a good listener. People’s appraisal of their listening ability is much
            like their assessment of their driving skills, in that the great bulk of adults think they’re above
            average. <br>
           
            Following are the general norms that one should follow to maintain the etiquette of a discussion:<br><br>

                <h1><center><b>What Great Listeners Actually Do?</b></center></h1>
                <p>Chances are you think you’re a good listener. People’s appraisal of their listening ability is much like
                    their assessment of their driving skills, in that the great bulk of adults think they’re above average.
                    <br><br> In our experience, much management advice on good listening means doing three things: <br><br>
                    ● Not talking when others are speaking<br>
                    ● Letting others know you’re listening through facial expressions and verbal sounds etc.<br>
                    ● Being able to repeat what others have said, practically word-for- word<br><br>
                    However, recent research that Dr Zenger and Folkman conducted suggests that these behaviors fall far
                    short of describing good listening skills. They analyzed data describing the behavior of 3,492 participants
                    in a development program designed to help managers become better coaches. As part of this program,
                    they identified those who were perceived as being the most effective listeners (the top 5%). They then
                    compared the best listeners to the average of all other people.<br>
                    <br>They found some surprising conclusions, along with some qualities they expected to hear:<br></p>

                Innovation is the practical implementation of ideas that results in the introduction of new goods or
                services or improvement in offering goods and services. Innovativeness is described in the
                Merriam-Webster dictionary as “the skill and imagination to create new things”. It basically means - thinking outside the box.

                To develop perseverance, it is very important that one should have goals and that too, smart. Everyone wants to be successful, right? And the first step to success is to persevere, never give up.
